# To-Do-App

Project structure is organized as follows:

- README.md: Documentation for your project.
- backend/: Contains all backend-related code.
- main.py: Entry point for running the FastAPI server.
- app/: A package for your FastAPI application code.
- __init__.py: Marks app as a Python package.
- api.py: Intended to define your FastAPI app and API routes (currently empty).


## Why this structure?

Separation of concerns: Backend code is isolated in the backend/ directory, making it easier to manage and scale.

Modularity: The app/ subpackage allows you to organize your API logic, models, and other components separately.

Entry point clarity: main.py is the script to launch your server, keeping startup logic separate from API definitions.

Scalability: As your app grows, you can add more modules (e.g., models.py, schemas.py, routes/) inside app/ without cluttering the root directory.

This structure is common in FastAPI projects and helps maintain clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
